There will be multiple NFT-using games on Solana as part of Magic Connect! Club. The focus here is games that are 1v1, quick to play, and exercise a degree of skill. These games will utilize NFTs, but NFTs are not required to enjoy them! Players will be able to earn if they have NFTs and win tournaments (which we intend to host frequently). Additionally, you will not need unique NFTs per game. Any NFT you get can be used in any game we make that is part of Magic Connect! Club.

Our first game as part of the Club is called MagiCard!, which will be a 1v1 trading-card-like game.
