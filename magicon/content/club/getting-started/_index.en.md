To get started with acquiring NFTs for Magic Connect!, you should do the following to start up on Solana. Our NFTs will initially only be available on Solana.

1. Set up a Solana wallet using an extension like [Phantom](https://phantom.app/).
1. Bridge some tokens from another network using something like [PortalBridge](https://www.portalbridge.com/#/transfer).

You're now ready!
