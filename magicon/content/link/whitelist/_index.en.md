To get put on the whitelist for Magic Connect! NFTs, you need to join [our Discord](https://discord.gg/magicconnect). While chatting, you'll slowly acquire coins. You can also gamble with these coins in #kroseis-tavern. When you get to 15,000, you can buy the whitelist role from the bot (Krosei Geyria / `UnbelievaBoat#1046`) by using `!buy-item 1 Magic Connect! Whitelist`.

This will grant you access to the #whitelist channel, if you also have the Crypto role (from #roles). From there, you must do `/submit` (remember to use your **Solana** address). Then you're done!
